# Teco-Customer-Churn-Analysis

Customer churn is one of the key challenges faced by businesses, especially in industries like telecommunications. It refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a company's services, which directly impacts revenue. In this project, we analyze customer churn data for Teco, a fictional telecommunications company, to identify the factors influencing churn and create predictive models to help the company retain customers more effectively.
